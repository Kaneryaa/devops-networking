# Computer networking basics 
Computer networking involves the interconnection of various devices and systems to enable them to communicate and share resources. Here are some basic components and concepts in computer networking

## Components
 **Devices**:

- Computers: These can be desktops, laptops, servers, or any device capable of running networking software.
- Switches and Routers: These are critical devices for directing network traffic. Switches connect devices within a local area network (LAN), while routers connect different networks and manage traffic between them.

**Network Interface Cards (NICs)**:

- NICs are hardware components that allow devices to connect to a network. They provide a physical connection to the network medium (like Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi).

**Cabling and Connectors**:

- Ethernet Cables: These are commonly used for wired network connections. They come in different categories (e.g., Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a) which determine their speed and bandwidth capabilities.
- Fiber Optic Cables: These use light signals to transmit data and are capable of high-speed, long-distance communication.
- Wireless: Wi-Fi is a common wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect without physical cables.

**Network Protocols:**

- Protocols are rules that govern how data is transmitted, received, and formatted in a network. Examples include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
**IP Addresses:**

- IP addresses uniquely identify devices on a network. IPv4 and IPv6 are the two main versions of the Internet Protocol in use today.
**Subnetting:**

- Subnetting involves dividing a network into sub-networks to improve performance, security, and manageability.
**Network Topologies:**

- Topology refers to the physical or logical layout of a network. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, and mesh.
**LAN and WAN:**

- LAN (Local Area Network): A network limited to a small geographic area, like a single building or a campus.
- WAN (Wide Area Network): Spans a large geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs across cities or countries.
**Firewalls and Security Devices:**

- Firewalls control the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an applied rule set. They are a critical component of network security.
**DNS (Domain Name System):**

- DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that machines can understand.

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:

- DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network, making it easier to manage large networks.
**Gateway**:

- The gateway is a device that connects a local network to the internet. It serves as an entry and exit point for data traffic.
- These are some fundamental components and concepts in computer networking. Understanding these basics is crucial for setting up and managing networks effectively.

  
## OSI Models 
**Physical Layer (Layer 1):**

- Function: This layer deals with the physical connection between devices. It defines the hardware, cables, and electrical signals used for transmission.
- Example: When you plug an Ethernet cable into a computer and a router, the physical layer is responsible for ensuring that electrical signals representing data can travel between them.
**Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**

- Function: This layer focuses on reliable point-to-point communication between directly connected devices. It handles issues like addressing, error detection, and flow control.
- Example: When you send a message over Wi-Fi, the data link layer ensures that the data frames are properly addressed to the intended recipient within your local network.
**Network Layer (Layer 3):**

- Function: The network layer enables communication between different networks. It's responsible for routing, logical addressing, and packet forwarding.
- Example: When you send an email to someone in a different city, the network layer determines the best path for your email to reach its destination across various routers and networks.
**Transport Layer (Layer 4):**

- Function: This layer ensures end-to-end communication and handles data flow control. It also addresses issues like reliability and error correction.
- Example: When you're streaming a video, the transport layer (TCP, for example) ensures that the video frames arrive in the correct order and retransmits any lost data packets.
**Session Layer (Layer 5):**

- Function: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections or sessions between applications. It handles tasks like authentication and synchronization.
- Example: When you log into a website, the session layer is involved in setting up and maintaining the connection between your browser and the server.
**Presentation Layer (Layer 6):**

- Function: This layer handles data translation and encryption, ensuring that information sent by one system can be understood by another. It also manages data compression.
- Example: When you download a file, this layer could be responsible for decompressing it and making sure it's in a format your computer can understand.
**Application Layer (Layer 7):**

- Function: The application layer is closest to the end-user and provides network services directly to user applications. It includes protocols for tasks like email, file transfer, and web browsing.
- Example: Browsers like Chrome or Firefox use application layer protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to retrieve and display web pages.

## Network Command 

To take user inputs in Python, you can use the `input()` function. By default, `input()` returns a string, so you'll need to convert it to the desired data type (int, float, or string) using `int()`, `float()`, or leave it as is.

Here's an example code that takes user inputs in different data types:

```python
# Taking an integer input
user_input_int = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# Taking a floating-point input
user_input_float = float(input("Enter a float: "))

# Taking a string input
user_input_string = input("Enter a string: ")

# Printing the inputs
print(f"You entered an integer: {user_input_int}")
print(f"You entered a float: {user_input_float}")
print(f"You entered a string: {user_input_string}")
```
